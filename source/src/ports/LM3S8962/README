README for the usage of OpENer with a LM3S8962 kit:

Depending on which eval kit you may have please install the kit

For example the eval kits for the Luminary/Texas Instruments(R)
LM3S8962 eval kit (display board or brushless DC boards) can 
be found here:
	http://www.ti.com/tool/sw-ek-lm3s8962
	http://www.ti.com/tool/sw-rdk-bldc

This port uses the MentorGraphics(R) Code Sourcery Lite ARM-NONE-EABI toolchain
 which can be found here: 
http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/overview

On Debian 7+ you need to install ia32-libs before you can install the
MentorGraphics(R) Code Sourcery Lite ARM-NONE-EABI toolchain. This manual can 
also be found at the MentorGraphics(R) website:

To install the ia32-libs enter the following commands, which must be executed
as root:

  dpkg --add-architecture i386
  apt-get update
  apt-get install ia32-libs ia32-libs-gtk

This part was also stated in the manual at MentorGraphics(R) but didn't work
for me, but I was able to install the toolchain anyhow

  wget https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/kbattach150/getlibs-all.deb
  sudo dpkg -i getlibs-all.deb
  sudo getlibs -p xulrunner-1.9.2
  export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib32/xulrunner-1.9.2.X

In addition the _sbrk function must be provided. An _sbrk implementation can
be found in newlib/libgloss/libnosys. The CMake script allows to enter the path
to the newlib source. The newlib source can be found at:
  https://sourceware.org/newlib/

If you are using newlib you have to add a user heap section to your linker 
script like the one provided here:

	/* User_heap_stack section, used to check that there is enough RAM 
	left */
	  ._user_heap_stack :
	  {
	    . = ALIGN(4);
	    PROVIDE ( end = . );
	    PROVIDE ( _end = . );
	    _heap_start_ = .;
	    . = . + _Min_Heap_Size;
	    _heap_end_ = .;
	    _stack_start_ = .;
	    . = . + _Min_Stack_Size;
	    _stack_end_ = .;
	    . = ALIGN(4);
	  } > SRAM 

Alternatively, the myLib provided on the CD of the board can be used 
instead of the newLib and the add-on to the linker script.

Unfortunatly, the myLib isn't provided in the offical download (at the time I 
was looking it up it was SW-EK-LM3S8962-10636) of the evaluation kit at the 
Texas Instruments(R) homepage.

Last, but not least, you place the your startup_gcc.c and linker script in the 
opener/source/src/ports/LM3S8962 directory.
